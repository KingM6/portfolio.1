   <p1>When I started the course in September, I didnt know what this course would be and when being college, I thought it was going to be the same as the course I choose back in college, but it was kind of similar. It was similar because I did some HTML, but the code was given to us but starting this course we had to type our own code which was kind of difficult because I didn’t know what this code was meant to do but after a while I started to understand the code and what it does and also I learn more about CSS because I did some of it back in college. But what helped me it was my teacher Chris which he helped a lot when it comes to coding and him giving us exercise to do really helped us to code and create our own website for the assignment. So for the assignment I had to create 5 pages using HTML and CSS, I used HTML to code my pages and inserting text and images, the CSS was for making my webpages colourful and to create my navigation bar for the website. Before I started coding, I had to make sure that I added a new branch on very page I made so that when I finish the branch I can merge it with my master branch so that will be easier to check when I commit to GitHub. So for my website I used columns to create it because I know using columns it would be easier for me.</p1>

    When I was doing my blog page, I had some problem with coding because my navigation bar wasn’t showing so that I mean from the blog page I couldn’t navigate so I had to check the code and correct the errors I made to make sure that my navigation bar worked. But every page that I made I styled the same apart from the home page because I wanted to be looking appealing for the user that is viewing it. I had some trouble with the homepage because my picture was too big, and I wanted to reduce the size and make my picture align in the centre of the page but with the help with my classmate I fixed the problem.
